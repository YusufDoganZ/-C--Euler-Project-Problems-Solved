C# Project Euler Solutions
I created this repository to solve Project Euler problems in C# ( C# .NET framework ) to demonstrate math and algorithm in a high level programming language ( 3GL ).

Getting Started
Run git clone command to get you a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
.NET Core SDK 2.0 or later
Git command line client
Text Editor
Installing
After running git clone and installing all prequisites you are ready to run the console application or each problem individually to see the answer.
Running
Run the application from the source code with dotnet run command in Command Prompt, without or with an argument which is the Project Euler problem number. For example: dotnet run 3 will display the answer for problem # 3. dotnet run will ask for a problem number.
Built With
.NET Core SDK and dotnet new console -lang C# -f netcoreapp2.0
Visual Studio Code or any other text editor such as ATOM
Solutions folder: each problem has a C# file
Solutions
Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5
Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers
Problem 3: Largest prime factor
Problem 4: Largest palindrome product
Problem 5: Smallest multiple
Problem 6: Sum square difference
Problem 7: 10001st prime ðŸ†•
Problem 8: Largest product in a series ðŸ†•
